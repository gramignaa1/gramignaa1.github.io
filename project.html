<tr><td>Abstract</td>
<td>
This article discusses various types of assistive technology (AT) used in special education to support students with disabilities. It categorizes AT tools into low-tech, mid-tech, and high-tech solutions, such as communication boards, speech-generating devices, and adaptive software. The article emphasizes how selecting the appropriate technology depends on student needs, learning goals, and environmental factors. It also highlights the role of educators and specialists in evaluating and implementing AT effectively. Overall, the study shows that assistive technology can significantly enhance independence, communication, and academic engagement when properly matched to learners.

<tr><td>Abstract</td>
<td>
This website provides an overview of assistive communication devices designed for individuals with speech and language impairments. It explains different augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools, including tablet-based systems and dedicated speech-generating devices. The site focuses on how these technologies support communication in educational and social settings. It also discusses customization options that allow educators and therapists to tailor devices to individual student needs. The resource demonstrates how AAC technology empowers students to express themselves and participate more fully in classroom activities.

<tr><td>Abstract</td>
<td>
This study examines the positive impact of assistive technology on students with disabilities in educational settings. The authors report that AT improves academic performance, independence, and student engagement. Benefits include increased access to curriculum materials, enhanced communication, and greater participation in classroom activities. The article also highlights how assistive technology supports inclusive education by allowing students with disabilities to learn alongside their peers. The findings suggest that when teachers receive adequate training and support, assistive technology becomes a powerful tool for improving learning outcomes and promoting equity in education.

<tr><td>Abstract</td>
<td>
This article explores how assistive technology supports learning and participation for students with disabilities. The authors describe improvements in academic skills, motivation, and self-confidence when AT is integrated effectively. They also discuss how technology fosters independence by reducing reliance on adults. The study emphasizes the importance of collaboration between teachers, students, and support staff to maximize benefits. Overall, the research demonstrates that assistive technology plays a critical role in creating inclusive and accessible educational environments.

<tr><td>Abstract</td>
<td>
This study examines barriers that limit the effective use of assistive technology in educational settings. Challenges include lack of teacher training, insufficient technical support, and limited access to appropriate devices. The authors also discuss financial constraints and difficulties matching technology to student needs. The article emphasizes that without proper planning and ongoing support, assistive technology may be underused or abandoned. Addressing these challenges is essential to ensure that AT fulfills its potential in supporting students with disabilities.

<tr><td>Abstract</td>
<td>
This article identifies challenges that affect assistive technology use for children with multiple disabilities. Barriers include inadequate staff training, negative attitudes toward technology, limited funding, and poor coordination among professionals. The authors explain that these challenges can prevent students from benefiting fully from assistive tools. They recommend a collaborative team-based approach to assessment and implementation to improve outcomes. The article highlights the importance of planning, training, and resource allocation when integrating assistive technology into education.
