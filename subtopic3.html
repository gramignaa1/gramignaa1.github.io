This study examines barriers that limit the effective use of assistive technology in educational settings. Challenges include lack of teacher training, insufficient technical support, and limited access to appropriate devices. The authors also discuss financial constraints and difficulties matching technology to student needs. The article emphasizes that without proper planning and ongoing support, assistive technology may be underused or abandoned. Addressing these challenges is essential to ensure that AT fulfills its potential in supporting students with disabilities.

<tr><td>Abstract</td>
<td>
This article identifies challenges that affect assistive technology use for children with multiple disabilities. Barriers include inadequate staff training, negative attitudes toward technology, limited funding, and poor coordination among professionals. The authors explain that these challenges can prevent students from benefiting fully from assistive tools. They recommend a collaborative team-based approach to assessment and implementation to improve outcomes. The article highlights the importance of planning, training, and resource allocation when integrating assistive technology into education.
